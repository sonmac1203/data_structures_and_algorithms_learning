# Data structures and algorithms learning
## Description
- This repository contains my implementations of some algorithms that I learn
- The files are written using Python
_ Current algorithms: linear search, binary search, recursive binary search, bogo sort, quick sort, selection sort, and merge sort
_ Current data structures: list (array), linked list
